# PRP-001: Multi-Company Authentication System for Transfer Generator

## Problem Statement

The existing Transfer Generator application was designed as a single-tenant system where all users shared the same data space. This created data isolation issues for businesses wanting to use the system with multiple companies or clients, requiring a complete architectural transformation to support multi-tenancy.

## Product Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR-001: Company Isolation**
- Each company must have completely isolated data (beneficiaries, templates, transfers, batches)
- No data leakage between companies
- Automatic filtering of all API calls by current company context

**FR-002: User Management**
- JWT-based authentication system
- Role-based access control (Company Admin, User)
- User registration with automatic company creation
- Company admins can invite and manage users

**FR-003: Multi-Company Support**
- Users can belong to multiple companies
- Company switching functionality
- Last active company preference
- Company context maintained throughout session

**FR-004: Backwards Compatibility**
- All existing features must continue to work
- Existing data must be migrated to default company
- No breaking changes to core functionality

### Technical Requirements

**TR-001: Backend Architecture**
- Django REST Framework with JWT authentication
- Company-scoped database models
- Middleware for automatic company context
- Migration strategy for existing data

**TR-002: Frontend Architecture**
- React TypeScript with Material-UI
- Authentication context and protected routes
- Token management with automatic refresh
- Company switcher component

**TR-003: Security**
- Secure JWT token handling
- Company-based permissions
- Protected API endpoints
- Role validation on sensitive operations

### User Experience Requirements

**UX-001: Authentication Flow**
- Clean login/register interface with branding
- Automatic login after registration
- Clear error messaging
- Hungarian localization

**UX-002: Company Management**
- Intuitive company switching
- Company information display
- User management interface for admins
- Role indicators and permissions

## Success Criteria

1. **Data Isolation**: 100% separation between companies with zero data leakage
2. **User Adoption**: Seamless transition for existing users with no training required
3. **Performance**: No degradation in application performance
4. **Security**: All authentication flows secure and tested
5. **Scalability**: System supports unlimited companies and users

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation
- Database model updates with company relationships
- JWT authentication implementation
- Company middleware and permissions
- Data migration scripts

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration
- Authentication context and components
- Protected routing system
- Company switcher implementation
- User management interface

### Phase 3: Testing & Optimization
- Comprehensive testing of multi-tenancy
- Performance optimization
- Security audit
- Documentation updates

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-001: Company Registration

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- Data migration complexity
- Authentication security vulnerabilities

**Medium Risk:**
- Performance impact of company filtering
- User experience disruption

**Low Risk:**
- Frontend compilation issues
