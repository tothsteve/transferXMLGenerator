```python
# Enhanced Beneficiary model with invoice context
class Beneficiary(models.Model):
    # Existing fields...
    source = models.CharField(
        max_length=20,
        choices=[('MANUAL', 'Manual'), ('NAV_INVOICE', 'NAV Invoice'), ('IMPORT', 'Import')],
        default='MANUAL'
    )
    nav_supplier_tax_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True)
    last_invoice_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    total_invoice_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=15, decimal_places=2, default=0)
    invoice_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    auto_created_from_invoice = models.ForeignKey(
        'Invoice', 
        null=True, 
        blank=True, 
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        related_name='created_beneficiaries'
    )
```

#### 2. Invoice-Transfer Relationship
```python
# Enhanced Transfer model with invoice linking
class Transfer(models.Model):
    # Existing fields...
    related_invoice = models.ForeignKey(
        'Invoice',
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        related_name='related_transfers'
    )
    invoice_payment_status = models.CharField(
        max_length=20,
        choices=[
            ('PENDING', 'Fizetés függőben'),
            ('PARTIAL', 'Részlegesen fizetve'),

        self.company = company
    
    def process_incoming_invoice(self, invoice):
        """Process incoming invoice and create/update beneficiary if needed"""
        # Check if supplier already exists
        # Create new beneficiary with invoice context
        # Update existing beneficiary with latest invoice info
        pass
    
    def suggest_bank_account(self, supplier_tax_number):
        """Suggest bank account number from historical data or external sources"""
        pass

        """Match completed transfers to pending invoices"""
        # Amount-based matching with tolerance
        # Date-based matching within payment windows
        # Reference number matching
        # Supplier-based matching
        pass
    
    def calculate_match_confidence(self, transfer, invoice):
        """Calculate confidence score for transfer-invoice match"""
        # Exact amount match: 40 points
        # Date proximity: 30 points
