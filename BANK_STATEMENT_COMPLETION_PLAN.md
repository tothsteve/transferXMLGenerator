## 🎉 Recent Achievements (2025-10-19)

### GRÁNIT Bank Adapter - Complete Rewrite ✅

**Problem Solved:**
- Original adapter only extracted 4 transactions from a 5-page PDF (should have been 27)
- Missing all detailed transaction data (IBANs, BICs, transaction IDs, fees, references)
- Only captured first line of multi-line transaction blocks

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced Database Schema:**
   - Added 4 new fields to `BankTransaction` model:
     - `beneficiary_bic` - Beneficiary's BIC code
     - `partner_id` - End-to-end partner identifier
     - `transaction_type_code` - Bank-specific transaction type (e.g., "001-00")
     - `fee_amount` - Transaction fees (e.g., "Előjegyzett jutalék")
   - Created migration `0040_add_transaction_fields`
   - Updated serializers to include new fields

2. **Multi-Line Transaction Parsing:**
   - Implemented smart transaction block detection using date + amount patterns
   - Detects transaction headers (lines with space-separated amounts like "-361 250")
   - Distinguishes between transaction headers and detail lines
   - Collects all lines from transaction start until next transaction begins

3. **Complete Field Extraction:**
   - **Transfer transactions:** IBANs, BICs, transaction IDs, partner IDs, references, fees
   - **POS purchases:** Card numbers, merchant locations, transaction times
   - **AFR transfers:** Payment IDs, transaction IDs, fees
   - **Fee amounts:** Extracted from "Előjegyzett jutalék:" lines

4. **Summary Section Handling:**
   - Added end-of-section detection for "SZÁMLÁZOTT TÉTELEK" marker
   - Prevents parsing summary/invoice tables as transactions
   - Stops at "Üzenetek:" section boundary

**Test Results:**
```
✅ PDF: BK_1_PDF_kivonat_20250131_1210001119014874.pdf
✅ Pages: 5
✅ Transactions extracted: 27/27 (100% accuracy)
✅ All fields populated: IBANs, BICs, IDs, fees, references
✅ No false positives from summary section
✅ Transaction breakdown:
   - POS purchases: 11
   - Transfer debits: 9
   - Transfer credits: 1
   - AFR debits: 2
   - AFR credits: 1
   - Interest credits: 1
   - Other (fees): 2
```

**Files Modified:**
- `bank_transfers/models.py` - Added 4 new fields
- `bank_transfers/migrations/0040_add_transaction_fields.py` - Database migration
- `bank_transfers/serializers.py` - Updated BankTransactionSerializer
- `bank_transfers/services/bank_statement_parser_service.py` - Save new fields
- `bank_transfers/bank_adapters/base.py` - Added fields to NormalizedTransaction dataclass
- `bank_transfers/bank_adapters/granit_adapter.py` - **Complete rewrite** with multi-line parsing

**Key Technical Improvements:**
- Transaction header detection: `re.search(r'\s[\d\-]+\s\d{3}', line)` for space-separated amounts
- Detail line exclusion: Skip lines with keywords like "jutalék", "Beérkezés", "Előjegyzett"
- Block collection: Collect all lines from header until next header
- Regex field extraction: 15+ regex patterns for extracting IBANs, BICs, IDs, fees, etc.
- End marker detection: Stop parsing at summary section markers

## 🎯 High Priority Tasks (Essential for Full Functionality)

### Task 1: TransactionMatchingService - Auto-Match to NAV Invoices
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours
**Value:** HIGH - This is the most valuable feature for users

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Create matching service file:**
   - Location: `backend/bank_transfers/services/transaction_matching_service.py`
   - Class: `TransactionMatchingService`

2. **Implement 3 matching strategies:**
   ```python
   Strategy 1: Reference Exact Match (confidence: 1.00)
   - Match transaction.reference to invoice.invoice_number
   - Match transaction.reference to invoice.supplier_tax_number

   Strategy 2: Amount + IBAN Match (confidence: 0.95)
   - Match transaction.amount to invoice.gross_amount_huf
   - Match transaction.payer_iban or beneficiary_iban to invoice supplier

   Strategy 3: Fuzzy Name Match (confidence: 0.70-0.90)
   - Use fuzzywuzzy or rapidfuzz library
   - Match transaction payer_name/beneficiary_name to invoice.supplier_name
   - Match transaction.amount to invoice.gross_amount_huf (within tolerance)
   ```

3. **Auto-update invoice payment status:**
   - If confidence >= 0.90: Auto-mark invoice as PAID
   - Set invoice.payment_status_date = transaction.booking_date
   - Set invoice.auto_marked_paid = True

4. **Add matching trigger:**
   - Call matching service after statement parsing in `BankStatementParserService`
   - Run matching on upload automatically

5. **Files to modify:**
   - Create: `services/transaction_matching_service.py`
   - Modify: `services/bank_statement_parser_service.py` (add matching call)
   - Modify: `api_views.py` (optional manual matching endpoints)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Service can match transactions to invoices with 3 strategies
- [ ] Confidence scores calculated correctly
- [ ] High-confidence matches auto-update invoice payment status
- [ ] Matching runs automatically on PDF upload
- [ ] Match results visible in API response

   total_debits = models.DecimalField(max_digits=15, decimal_places=2, default=0)
   ```

2. **Create migration:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations bank_transfers -n add_statement_statistics
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Update BankStatementParserService:**
   - Calculate statistics after parsing all transactions

       for template in FeatureTemplate.objects.all():
           template.features['BANK_STATEMENT_IMPORT'] = False
           template.save()
   ```

3. **Create permission class:**
   ```python
   # bank_transfers/permissions.py
   class RequireBankStatementImport(BasePermission):
       def has_permission(self, request, view):
           company = getattr(request.user, 'active_company', None)
           if not company:
               return False
           return company.has_feature('BANK_STATEMENT_IMPORT')
   ```

   ```

2. **Update BankStatementParserService:**
   ```python
   def _save_file(self, uploaded_file, statement):
       # Create directory structure: bank_statements/{company_id}/{year}/{month}/
       path = f"bank_statements/{company.id}/{year}/{month}/{filename}"

       # Save file to filesystem
       with open(full_path, 'wb') as f:
           f.write(uploaded_file.read())

       # Update statement.file_path
       statement.file_path = path
   ```

3. **Add file download endpoint:**
   ```python
   @action(detail=True, methods=['get'])
   def download(self, request, pk=None):
       """Download original PDF file"""
       statement = self.get_object()
       # Return file response
   ```

   if trans_data.transaction_type in ['POS_PURCHASE', 'ATM_WITHDRAWAL', 'BANK_FEE']:
       transaction.is_extra_cost = True

       # Set category
       if trans_data.transaction_type == 'POS_PURCHASE':
           transaction.extra_cost_category = 'CARD_PURCHASE'
       elif trans_data.transaction_type == 'ATM_WITHDRAWAL':
           transaction.extra_cost_category = 'CASH_WITHDRAWAL'
       elif trans_data.transaction_type == 'BANK_FEE':
           transaction.extra_cost_category = 'BANK_FEE'
   ```

2. **Update tests:**

    Bulk categorize transactions by keywords or rules.

    Request:
    {
        "transaction_ids": [1, 2, 3],

   ```

2. Collect warnings during parsing:
   ```python
   warnings = []
   if closing_balance is None:
